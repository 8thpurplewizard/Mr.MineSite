    <h1>Mr.Mine Portal</h1>
    <h2>The purpose of this page:</h2>
    <p>I've created this page so all the resources that have been around the discord server and the wiki can be displayed all together here. Totally a personal choice here so expect me to forget some as I finish up this project of mine. :")</p>
